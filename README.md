# Sentiment Analysis Project using Natural Language Processing.
## Planet Solver - A Product Pitch by Emerald; a team of Data Scientists
Many companies are built around lessening environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products 
and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals.

Emerald, a team of Data Scientist in this project pitched a product that can help companies to determine 
how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add 
to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

### Task
Emerald was challenged in the Classification Sprint with the task of creating a Machine Learning model 
that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change,  based on their novel tweet data.

### Objective
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer 
sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and 
informing future marketingÂ strategies.
