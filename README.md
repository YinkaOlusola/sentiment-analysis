# Sentiment Analysis Project using Natural Language Processing.
## Planet Solver - A Product Pitch by Emerald; a team of Data Scientists
Many companies are built around lessening environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products 
and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals.

Emerald, a team of Data Scientists in this project pitched a product that can help companies to determine 
how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add 
to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

### Task
Emerald was challenged in the Classification Sprint with the task of creating a Machine Learning model 
that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change,  based on their novel tweet data.

### Objective
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer 
sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and 
informing future marketingÂ strategies.

## The Notebook
The project was done in a Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook contains

- Introduction

- Import Packages and Loading Data

- Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The Data was cleaned and important visualizations about the available data were carried out

- Data Engineering: The data set being text data was put in a format that can be used in a machine learning algorithm.

- Machine Learning Model training: Different machine learning models were considered; Logistic Regression,
  Support Vector Classifier, Random forest classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, and K Nearest Neighbour classification.

- Model Performance: This was tracked using Comet, a web-based platform used for keeping records of machine learning model performance.
  The model with the best performance, SVC, was selected and used to make predictions that were used for the Kaggle competition.

- Recommendations: These were made based on the result of the project.

## Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source app framework in Python language that is used to create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.
