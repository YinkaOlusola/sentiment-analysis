# Streamlit-based Web Application


## 1) Overview

As part of the predict, students are expected to expand on this base template; increasing the number of available models, user data exploration capabilities, and general Streamlit functionality.    

#### Streamlit

Streamlit is a framework based on Python Programming language that is used to build interactive web applications for Data Science and Machine Learning projects.

In its own words:
> Streamlit ... is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours!  All in pure Python. All for free.

> Itâ€™s a simple and powerful app model that lets you build rich UIs incredibly quickly.

Streamlit takes away much of the background work needed in order to get a platform that can deploy models to clients and end users.
Meaning that one gets to focus on the important stuff (related to the data), and can largely ignore the rest. This will allow one to become a lot more productive.

## Running Streamlit on a remote AWS EC2 instance

For this project, the web application created with Streamlit was deployed and hosted on Amazon EC2 Instance.

Due to the cost of running the Amazon EC2 instance, the personal version of the web application has been hosted on Streamlit cloud service
and the web application can be accessed at [Sentiment Analysis web application]().
